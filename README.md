# Wireframe Data Lineage & Schema MVP

This application is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) designed to bridge the gap between Figma wireframes, data lineage, and schema for complex data management systems. It provides a centralized platform for teams to visualize, collaborate on, and understand the relationships between UX designs and underlying data structures.

## Features

* **Figma Integration:**
    * Upload or link Figma wireframes directly to the application.
    * Annotate specific elements within the wireframes to connect them to data lineage and schema.
* **Data Lineage Linking:**
    * Visually link annotated wireframe elements to data lineage information.
    * Define and visualize data flows associated with the wireframe elements.
* **Schema Visualization:**
    * Generate visual representations of data schemas associated with linked data lineage.
    * Explore and understand relationships between data fields.
* **Shared Workspaces/Projects:**
    * Create shared workspaces or projects for teams to organize and collaborate on wireframes, data lineage, and schema.
* **Commenting and Discussion Threads:**
    * Facilitate communication with commenting and discussion threads on wireframe elements, data lineage nodes, and schema fields.
    * @ mention users within comments.
* **Version Control and History:**
    * Track changes to wireframe annotations and data lineage links.
    * Revert to previous versions and view change history, including who made the changes.
* **Data Dictionary and Glossary:**
    * Maintain a data dictionary and glossary for definitions and descriptions of schema fields.
    * Link glossary terms to elements within the wireframes.
* **Search and Filter:**
    * Find specific wireframes, schema elements, and glossary terms.
* **Exporting:**
    * Export the current view of the wireframe, schema and data lineage in a readable format, such as a PDF or HTML.
